# Student-Streaks-Analysis-with-SQL
This project analyzes user learning streaks (32 days of data) using SQL. I explored streak activity, created streak-length buckets, and identified top users with 30+ day streaks. Insights highlight most users drop off early, while a few sustain long streaksâ€”leading to recommendations for engagement strategies.
